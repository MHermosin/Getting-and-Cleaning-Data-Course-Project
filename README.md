# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users.
This project uses the data collected and filtered from the sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) of the Samsung Galaxy S II smart phone, where it is worked and cleaned to prepare the tidy data that can be used in a later analysis.
This repository contains the following files:
•	README.md; This file contains basic project information, such as the general description of the data set and how it was created.
•	CodeBook.md; The codebook describes the variables, the data and any transformation or work done to clean the data.
•	run_analysis.R; The R script that was used to create the data set (see the Create the Data Set section below).
•	tidy_data.txt; Text file that contains the data set.
